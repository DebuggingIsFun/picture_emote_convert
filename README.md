## What pupose?
My partner makes drawings for costume Emotes, because of fun.
Since the swtich to linux the tool, that was used does not work anymore.
Because it is Windows only.

So I thought let us make a python script that will do the same thing.

Take a Image and save it in the correct sizes like e.g Twtich Emotes (28x28, 56x56 and 112x112)

## Why two scripts?
The [raw_script.py](./raw_script.py) is the "raw" Idea how it can work.
So like a blueprint you could say.
The [script_in_functions.py](./script_in_functions.py) is the "cleandup" and more readable script.
They both do the same.
And both will be updated since I will first work in the [raw_script.py](./raw_script.py) for the rough idea (Prototyp) and
afterwards add it the the other script in a more readbale way.

[raw_script.py](./raw_script.py) will also be made a bit more readable in the future.

## TODO
Make more sizes availalbe and more dynamic. (Like more Formats)
