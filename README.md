## What pupose?
My partner makes drawings for costume Emotes, because of fun.
Since the swtich to linux the tool, that was used does not work anymore.
Because it is Windows only.

So I thought let us make a python script that will do the same thing.

Take a Image and save it in the correct sizes like e.g Twtich Emotes (28x28, 56x56 and 112x112)

## TODO
Cleanup Code and make it more readble!
Make more sizes availalbe and more dynamic.
